On top of that, performing change detection over the entire component tree, corresponding to a complex UI, often causes frame drops because of heavy computations happening in the main thread.In the first part of this talk we‚Äôre going explain essential practices that can help us reduce the initial load time of our Angular applications. In it‚Äôs second part, we‚Äôll discuss different techniques which can improve the runtime performance of our application in order to help us achieve rendering with 60fps!',
